# "Elder Circle"
### An attempt at cloning Elden Ring in Unity and making it my own.
#### Unity Version:2021.3.10f1

After working with Unity for a while to make small projects, I've decided to take on a larger project using Sebastian Graves' tutorials as a base for building this game.
This isn't intended to be released, but building this project will allow me to move forward in my game development.

Some goals are:
 - A fluid combat system (Similar unequipped combat to Rogue)
 - Good movement mechanics (Adding on to Elden Ring's basic jump, roll, & sprint)
 - An interesting magic system
 - Learning 3d modeling and getting better at 3d art in general
 - Inspired by Withersworn's devlog. I hope to get the art in this game to a place that I'm happy with and excited to show off
 - Keeping a structured codebase, maintaining good practices, and gaining experience with C#
